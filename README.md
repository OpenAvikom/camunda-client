# camunda-external-task-client-python3

!! This is a fork of ![yogeshrnaik/camunda-external-task-client-python3](https://github.com/yogeshrnaik/camunda-external-task-client-python3). It is not compatible with the original code base any longer.!!

This fork makes use of `async/await` and operates workers asynchronously rather than threaded. Additionally, it contains some convenience functions that wrap the Camunda REST API and speed up development.
